**PostgreSQL** is the best choice beacuse:

- **advanced SQL features** (e.g., window functions, CTEs).
- **ACID compliance** and strong data integrity.
- **complex queries** and large datasets.
- **JSON support** alongside relational data.

---

### **Why PostgreSQL?**

- **Advanced Features**: Supports complex queries, transactions, and JSON.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and high concurrency well.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity and reliability.
- **Flexibility**: Combines relational and NoSQL features (e.g., JSONB).

**Next.js (frontend)**, **Actix-Web (backend)** and **PostgreSQL** is the best choice because:

- **Next.js** offers a modern, performant, and scalable frontend solution.
- **Actix-Web** delivers top-tier backend performance and reliability.
- **PostgreSQL** delivers strong data integrity and JSON support
- Together, they form a robust, high-performance stack for any application size.
